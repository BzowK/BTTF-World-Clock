# BTTF-World-Clock
Delorean clock - Back to the future style clock - with 3 Timezones

This is a combination of the Marquee Scroller code & the Delorean Back to the Future style clock.

Red clock top gives one timezone (clock) with a date of your choice

Green clock middle gives your the actual timezone that you're from

Orange clock gives the last timezone (clock) with date of your choice
